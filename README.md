# The Heliocentric Method

[日本語版はこちら (View in Japanese)](./README.ja.md)

**The era of AI-centric creation is over. You are the sun of your story.**

This is the home port for **The Heliocentric Method**, a conceptual framework that brings a new perspective to storytelling in the age of AI.

It is also part of [Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster), a research ecosystem exploring human-AI co-creation.

## Introduction: Why "Heliocentric"?

Traditional AI-driven writing often feels like a "geocentric" model. We anxiously await the whimsical outputs of a colossal celestial body—the AI—scrambling to steer it toward our desired results. In this model, the AI is the center, and the author is merely a planet at its mercy.

**The Heliocentric Method** inverts this relationship.

**The creative sun should not be the AI, but the author's vision itself.**

AI, prompts, and other tools are merely planets and satellites, orbiting this sun, guided by its gravitational pull to illuminate the author's creativity. This repository is a compass for authors to reclaim their position as the creative sun and a place to explore this practical methodology.

## The Core of the Heliocentric Method

| | ❌ **Geocentric Model** | ✅ **Heliocentric Model** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Center** | The AI's output, its capabilities | **The author's vision, theme, and passion** |
| **Author's Role** | An operator trying to appease the AI | **The creator and conductor of the story's universe** |
| **Prompt** | A magic spell with unpredictable results | **A blueprint, a set of instructions to convey intent** |
| **Process** | Modifying the story to fit the AI's output | **Using the AI as a tool to realize the story** |
| **Goal** | "An amazing text written by an AI" | **"The story the author wanted to express"** |

We don't let the AI "write for us"; we **"use"** the AI to write.

## Projects and Prompts

This repository contains projects that put the Heliocentric Method into practice.

    *   **Prompt:** The core prompt is located at [`Heliocentric_Novel_Writer.en.md`](./novel_writer_as_a_heliocentric/prompts/en/Heliocentric_Novel_Writer.en.md).
    *   **Example Output:** See a sample novel generated with this method in [`crimson-roar-descent-one-shot.md`](./novel_writer_as_a_heliocentric/prompts/en/examples/ai-novelAI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid-generated-sample-crimson-roar-descent-one-shot.md).

## Migration Note

Some content in this repository has been migrated from the former `AI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid` repository, reflecting the evolution of the core philosophy.

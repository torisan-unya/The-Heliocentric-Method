# The Heliocentric Method

[日本語版はこちら (View in Japanese)](./README.ja.md)

**The era of AI-centric creation is over. You are the sun of your story.**

This repository hosts **The Heliocentric Method**, a framework reorienting AI-assisted storytelling to prioritize the author's vision. It empowers creators to use AI as orbiting tools—prompts, agents, and models—rather than deferring to AI as the creative core. Part of the [Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster) ecosystem, it explores human-AI co-creation grounded in recent research on author-centric narratives.

Part of the [Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster), this project advances Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) principles.

## Why Heliocentric?

In geocentric AI writing, outputs revolve around the model's whims, leaving authors in reactive orbits. The Heliocentric Method flips this: your vision is the gravitational center, with AI as satellites amplifying intent.

| Aspect          | ❌ Geocentric (AI-Centric)                  | ✅ Heliocentric (Author-Centric)                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Center**      | AI's capabilities and outputs              | Author's vision, theme, and intent              |
| **Author's Role**| Operator tweaking prompts reactively       | Conductor directing AI tools proactively        |
| **Prompts**     | Unpredictable spells for AI approval       | Blueprints executing authorial control          |
| **Process**     | Adapting story to AI limitations           | Shaping AI to realize the envisioned narrative  |
| **Goal**        | Impressive AI-generated text               | Author's authentic story, enhanced by AI        |

This shift aligns with emerging research, such as the Universal Narrative Model (UNM), which positions authors at the heart of generative AI storytelling for coherent, intent-driven narratives. Studies on creative writers' AI integration further validate human-led practices, emphasizing routines that preserve authorial voice.

## Core Projects and Resources

## Evolution and Migration

Content from the former `AI-Novel-Prompt-Hybrid` repository has evolved here, reflecting a refined philosophy: from hybrid prompts to fully author-orchestrated systems.
